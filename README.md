### Application Walk Through

 The application renders different images to the screen (set of 12). Each image then listens for click events.

The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

 Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.

 Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts
